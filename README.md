Requires underscore.js

npm install underscore

We extracted colour names from W3Schools using extract.js and put them into colours.js

run the code with node colours.js [y/n] [colour]

e.g. node colours.js y #ff01ab

the y/n indicates if our "additional named colours" should run which gives longer, weirder, or more accurate results.
